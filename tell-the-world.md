Tell The World

(The ?? indicate words I'm not 100% about. Help.)

Peace to the Standing Rock Sioux        
Clean water for Flint Michigan        
Free Mumia        
Free Palestine        
Free Leonard Peltier        
Free all political prisoners        
Legalize all drugs, dude        
Free everybody        
Abolish jail        
Institute a basic income        
Existence is a human right, basically at this point right, in our technical evolution?        
I got I call, hold up, yo        
Listen to your guy's wild elocution, ooh, son        
Rooftop gardens, solar energy        
I think I'm Ajamu Baraka        
Bustin' tags on rigged voting machines        
Peace alive, destroy, uh, police property        
Build a new concept of well being out of mutually understood concepts of the beautiful        
It's really quite simple        
Manchurian candidate style        
Hella various aisles to walk down        
I'm with the diamond or the center lane        
Sometimes I'm sitting in a black leather chair moving faster than the earth's rotation        
Keep my notation        
A beast to no nation        
At least I believe to be        
Every single moment of life is both precious and earned        
Every single knowledge is learned        
At the instant of air touching lungs        
The spirit is the hum, the tributary        
From which all rivers flow        
Metaphor is never specific        
It never means to be        
Study my intrinsically executed style        
Styles upon impeccable styles        
Impeccatuity?? Who is he?        
I rapped over the hook, but I don't give a fuck, Kool A.D.        
I wanna tell the world, turn up, it's your party        
Ha ha, hardy har har        
I'm mighty funny        
But I'm no dummy        
Rest in peace, Prince Nelson        
Peace to Gene Wilder, Ali, Bomaye        
Peace alive, Richard Pryor, bench one??        
Austin Prior??        
Fake thugs is liars        
Peace alive, Tupac        
Jah Rastafari        
Everybody grindin'         
Trust your own struggle, man        
Follow your central vibrations        
Imbibe libations        
It's a vivation        
Be your own private satellite space station        
Your spirit stayed tethered to the forever infinite untethered        
Never nothing total everything relevant        
To anything ever, under, or over understood        
Whatever your boy told you good, ha
