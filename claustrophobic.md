claustrophobic
===============================================================================

by Sheena Calie

We sold so many words for laughs,  
you'd think we'd found freedom by now,  
not still clinging,   
like Latin inscribed on ancient stone.  

 Our celiacs, bone spurrs, dandruff,  
 the need to wear panty hose and smoke cigarettes at 2AM;  
 the only thing that sets us apart  
 are the words  
 we choose  
 as the darkness finds it way to the top.
